# Chapter 1 
# Social Engineering:

**Def: "The method of using people as part of an attack process"**

Social engineering typically involves some form of social interaction.
- Weakness being exploited is not one of technical expertise
- Much of social engineering plays on known sterypotpical behaviour

Best defense against social engineering attacks is comprehensive training and awareness program that includes social engineering

--- 

## Tools of Social Engineers
- Based on a knowledge of psychology not necessarily requiring a sophisticated knowledge of software or hardware
- Social engineers employ strategies aimed at exploiting people's own biases and beliefs

# Techniques of Social Engineering:  

---
## Phishing 
***Def: Type of Social Engineering in which the attacker attempts to obtain sensitive information from users by masquerading as a trust entity in an e-mail or IM sent to a large group of often random users***

The message that is sent often encourages users to go to websites that appear reputible

Users then supply important information to these fake websites allowing phishers to steal their data

Another common example of phising involves the attacker sending a bulk e-mail supposedly from a bank, telling them a breach has occured. 

**NOTE: Phising is the most common form of social engineering attacks related to computer security**
--- 
## Smishing
**Def: An attack using Short Message Service (SMS) on victims cellphones**

Like phishing but with SMS

Process:
- Begins with an SMS message directing a user to a URL that can include a variety of attack vectors including forms of malware
- Once user clicks on URL, the actual attack can begin

---
## Vishing
**Def: A variation of phishing that uses voice communication technology to obtain the information that attacker is seeking**

Takes advantage of the trust that some people place in the telephone network.
- Users are unaware that attackers can spoof (simulate) calls from legititmate entities using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology.

Users will often be asked to provide sensitive information quickly.

## Note:
Phishing, Smishing, and Vishing- these are attacks against users congnitive states. 

___
## Spam
**Def: bulk unsolicitated email**

While not considered a social engineering or security issue, it can still be a security concerns

Still has potential to be malicious, because it can result in users clicking links, it should be regarded as a form of altering human behaviour or social engineering.

___
## Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM)
**Def: spam delivered via an instant messaging application**

Same as spam just using SMS not email
___
## Spear Phishing 
**Def: phishing attack that targets a specific person or group of people with something in common**

Because the targer is specific enough, the ratio of successful attacks to the total number of e-mails or messages sent usually increases

___
## Dumpster Diving 
**Def: The process of going trhough a target's trash in hopes of finding valuable information that might be used in a penetration attempt.**

This is not unique to the computing community

Organizations should have policies about discarding materials. 

Shred important infromation 

___
## Shoulder Surfing
**Def: Attacker directly observes individual entering sensitive information on a form, key-pad, or keyboard. **

Many locations now use privacy screens or filter to surround keypads
___
## Pharming
**Def: Misdirecting users to fake websites made to look official**

Using phishing, attackers target individuals, one by one, sending out emails.

To become a victim, the target must take an action

This action redirects them to the fake website where they believe to be entering their material
___
## Tailgating
**Def: The simple tactic of following closely behind a person who has just used their own access card or PIN to gain physcial access to a room or building

Both tailgating and shoulder surfing attack techniques rely on the poor security practices of an authorized user in order to be successful. 

Solution is to train employees to use simple procedures to ensure nobody follows them too closely or is in a position to observe their actions.
___
## Eliciting Information
**Def: Calls to or form help desk and tech support units can be used to elicit information**

A skilled social engineer can use a wide range of psychological techniques to convince people, whose main job it is to help others, to perform taks resulting in security compromises. 

Attacker is basically calling employees or people of the company that deal with helping others
___
## Whaling
**Def: High value targets are often referred to as whales. A whaling attack is thus one where the target is a high-value person, such as a CEO or CFO. **

Attacks are custom built to increase the odds of sucess. 

Spear phishing is a common method used against whales, as the communication is designed to appear to be ordinary business for the target, being crafted to appear nonsuspicious. 
___
## Prepending
**Def: the act of adding something else to the beginning of an item**

In social engineering this means, supplying information that another will act upon, frequently before they ask for it, in an attempt to legitimize the actual request, which comes later.

Example: Saying they were sent by  the target's boss, or another authority figure, as a means to justify why the target should perform a specific action.
___
## Identity Fraud
**Def: The use of fake credentials to achieve an end.** 

Can often be high risk or low risking depending on who is being impersonated
___
## Invoice Scams
**Def: use a fake invoice in an attempt to get a company to pay for things it has not order.**
___
## Credential Harvesting
**Def: involves the collection of credential information, such as user IDs, passwords, and so on, enabling an attacker a series of access passes to the system.**

Common forms of credential harvesting start as phishing e-mails that convince a user to click a link and as a response, brings a replica of their bank's home page.

Two Factor Authentication is a good solution to this issue
___
## Reconnaissance
**Def: the actions of surveying a battlefield to gain information prior to hostilities.**

Some methods are outside purview of the victim: google searches, public records

Calling companies and building a directory, reading press releases are other examples
___
## Hoax
**Def: Causes users to take some sort of action that weakens security**
___
## Impersonation
**Def: Attacker assumes a role taht is recognized by the person being attacked**

Attacker uses the victim's biases against their better judgement
___
## Third-Party Authorization
**Def: Useing previously obtained information about a project, deadlines, bosses, and so on, the attacker:**
1. **Arrives with something the victim is quasi-expecting or would be see as normal**
2. **Uses the guise of a project in trouble or some other situation where the attacker will be viewed as helpful or as someone not to upset**
3. **name-drops the contact "Mr. Big", who happens to be out of the office and unreachable at the moment, thus avoiding the reference check.**

These actions create the appearence of a third party organization when there is in fact none
___
## Contractors/Outside Parties
**Def: Pretending to be a contractor or outside party to gain access to areas or materials**

Best defense for any impersonation attack is some form of ID checking
___
## Watering Hole Attack
**Def: Involves the infecting of a target website with malware**

Just like a hunter waits near a watering hole for animals to come drink, attackers can plant malware at sites where users are likely to frequent

They are typically complex to achieve and are backed by nation-states and other high-resource attackers 

Typically utlizie zero-day attacks to further avoid detection
___
## Typosquatting
**Def: an attack that involves capitalizing upon common typographical errors.**

Example: Users mistypes a URL and accidentally redirects to the attacker's page

Also refered to as: URL hijacking, fake URL,  brandjacking
___
### Pretexting
**Def: a form of social engineering in which the attacker uses a narrative to influence the victim into giving up some item of information**

Example: Calling up, posing as a fellow student from college, or a fellow admin to a senior executive

Uses deception and false motives to manipulate the victim. Main goal is to gain victims trust and exploit it.
___
## Influence Campaign
**Def: The use of collected information and selective publication of material to key individuals in an attempt to alter preceptions and change people's minds on a topic**

Work well with social media

Similar to propaganda
___
# The Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness) of Social Engineering
___
Social Engineering is successful for two primary reasons:
1. The basic desire for most people is to be helpful
2. Individuals seek to avoid confrontation and trouble

## Authority
The use of authority in social situations can lead to an environment where one party feels at risk in challenging another over an issue. 

## Intimidation
Can be either subtle, through perceived power, or more direct, through the use of communications that build an expectation of superiority

## Consensus
The social engineer motivates others to achieve their desired outcomes

## Scarcity
By giving the impression of scarcity of a desirable product, an attacker can motivate a target to make a decision quickly without hesitation

## Familiarity
The social engineer can focus the conversation on familiar items, not differences 

## Trust
Don't force people to do things they would not do, but rather give them a pathway that leads them to feel they are doing the correct thing in the moment

## Urgency
Perception is key. Giving the target a reason to believe that they can take advantage of a timely situation, whether or not it is real, achieves the outcome of them acting in a desired manner

# Defenses
- Starts with policies and procedures that eliminate the pathways used by these attacks
- The critical element is employee training
- Have multiple layers of defense including approvals and safeguards
