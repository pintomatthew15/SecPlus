# Chapter 34
# Risk Management

Risk management is a core business function of an enterprise because it is through the risk management process that an enterprise can maximize its return on investments.

## Risk Types
Risk can come from a wide range of sources. One way to organize different risks is to categorize them into a series of types.

There are six types of risk:
1. External
2. Internal
3. Legacy Systems
4. Multiparty
5. IP theft
6. Software compliance/licensing

### External
**Def: External threats come from outside the organization and, by definition, begin without access to the system.**
- Access is reserved for users who have a business need to know and have authorized accounts on the systems.
- This extra step and reliance on external connections typically makes external attacks easier to detect

### Internal
**Def: Internal threats include disgruntled employees and well-meaning employees who make mistakes or have an accident.
- Internal threats tend to be more damaging, as the perpetrator has already been granted some form of access.
- Risk is related to the level of access and the value of the asset being worked on.

### Legacy Systems
**Def: Legacy systems are older pre-existing systems.**
- The true issue behind what makes a system a legacy system is the concept of technical debt.
- **Def: Technical debt is the cost occurred over time as a result of not maintaining a system completely.**
- Like all debt, there is interest, and technical debt grows over time to where it can become a major issue in IT projects charged with updating older systems. 

### Multiparty
In traditional risk management, the driving factor under consideration is risk to one's own enterprise.
- In a traditional two-party system (an attacker versus a firm), the risk equations are fairly easy to determine and optimize.
- Multiple party systems make risk equations complicated

### IP Theft
If you ask an IT technician about cybersecurity risk, you might get an answer involving data loss, ransomware, viruses, malware, or fraud.
- Looking from a business perspective, Intellectual property theft (IP theft) can seriously damage a company's future health

IP theft is hard to attribute, and once the copy is in the marketplace, the only resort is courts via trade secret and patent protection actions.

### Software Compliance/Licensing
The source of software that functions as the backbones of our systems is licensing and in many cases trust.
- Copies of many software products can be made and used without licenses, and this creates **software compliance/licensing risk.**
- This kind of risk is best battled using policies and procedures

**EXAM TIP: BE able to identify the various risk types--external, internal, legacy systems, multiparty, IP theft, and software compliance/licensing. Know which risk management strategies and processes in the coming sections should be applied to each of the given risk types discussed.**

## Risk Management Strategies
Risk management can be described as a decision-making process.
- **Def: Risk management strategies include elements of threat assessment, risk assessment, and security implementation concepts, all positioned within the concept of business management.**
- The process may be iterative, as industry best practices clearly indicate that an important aspect of effectively managing risk is to consider it an ongoing process.

Risks are absolutes--they cannot be removed or eliminated. 
- You can mitigate risk  but you can never fully remove it
- Risk can be avoided, transferred, mitigated, or accepted

**EXAM TIP: You can do four things to respond to risk: accept it, transfer it, avoid it, and mitigate it. Understand the differences, as these will be presented as possible answer choices for a question, and the scenario details will apply to one better than the others.**

### Acceptance
When you're analyzing a specific risk, after weighing the cost to avoid, transfer, or mitigate a risk against the probability of its occurrence and its potential impact, the best response is to **accept the risk**.

### Avoidance
Avoiding the risk can be accomplished in many ways. 
- Although you can't remove threats from the environment, you can later the system's exposure to the threats.

### Transference
**Def: Transference of risk is when the risk in a situation is covered by another entity.**
- The mistake many make is assuming the risk transfers. The only risk transference that occurs across these legal agreements is that defined in the contract.

Another common example or risk transfer is the protection against fraud that consumers have on their credit cards.
- The risk is transferred to another party, so people can use their cards in confidence.
- As in the previous discussion, this transference is in the fine print of the credit card agreement.

#### Cybersecurity Insurance
A common method of transferring risk is to purchase **cybersecurity insurance**. 
- Insurance allows risk to be transferred to a third party that manages specific types of risk for multiple parties, thus reducing the individual cost.

### Mitigation
Risks can also be **mitigated** through the application of controls that reduce the impact of an attack.
- Controls can alert operators so that the level of exposure is reduced through process intervention. 
- Controls such as these can act to reduce the risk associated with potential high-risk operations.

## Risk Analysis
To effectively manage anything, there must be appropriate measurements to guide the course of actions.
- In the case of risk, this is also true. To manage risk, there needs to be a measurement of loss, and potential loss, and much of this information comes by way of **risk analysis**. 
- Then, through further analysis, the information can be refined to a workable plan to manage the risk to an acceptable level. 

### Risk Register
**Def: A risk register is a list of the risks associated with a system.**
- It also can contain additional information associated with the risk element, such as categories to group like risks, probability of occurrence, impact to the organization, mitigation factors, and other data. 
- There is no standardized form, the project management institute has one format, other sources have different formats. 

### Risk Matrix/Heat Map
**Def: A risk matrix or heat map is used to visually display the results of a qualitative risk analysis.**
- This method allows expert judgement and experience to assume a prominent role in the risk assessment process and is easier than trying to exactly define a number for each element of risk.
- To access risk qualitatively, you first determine the likelihood of a threat occurring and also the consequence should it occur.

### Risk Control Assessment
**Def: A risk control assessment is a tool used by the Financial Industry Regulator Authority (FINRA) to access a series of risks associated with their member institutions.**
- Questions are asked about a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity and the answers help paint a picture of the organization's security posture.

### Risk Control Self-Assessment
**Def: Risk control self-assessment is a technique that employs management and staff of all levels to identify and evaluate risks and associated controls.**
- This information is collected and analyzed to produce a more comprehensive map of risks and the controls in place to address it.

### Risk Awareness
**Def: Risk awareness is knowledge of risk and consequences.**
- Essential for wide ranges of personnel, with the content tailored to other contributions to the enterprise.
- Just as the beginning of the famous twelve-step program is acknowledging the problem, becoming aware of risk is important if one is to manage it.

### Inherent Risk
**Def: Inherent risk is defined as the amount of risk that exists in the absence of controls.**
- No controls includes no access controls, no door locks, no personnel background checks--in essence an environment that would equate to everything becoming high-risk.

### Residual Risk
The presence of risks in a system is an absolute--they cannot be removed or eliminated.
- Whatever risk is not transferred, mitigated, or avoided is referred to as **residual risk** and, by definition, is accepted. 

### Control Risk
**Def: Control risk is a term used to specify risk associated with the chance of a material misstatement in a company's financial statements.**
- This risk can be manifested in a couple ways: either there isn't an appropriate set of internal controls to mitigate a particulate risk or the internal controls set in place malfunctioned.

**EXAM TIP: Inherent risk is the amount of risk that exists in the absence of controls. Residual risk is the amount of risk that remains after controls are accounted for. Control risk is when the risk specifically affects the financial reporting.**

### Risk Appetite
Different firms in different businesses and environments have different risk exposures, but they also have different tolerances for risk.
- **Risk appetite** is the term used to describe a firm's tolerance for risk. 
- Even within a sector, with companies of the same size, operating in roughly the same areas, there can be differences in the level of risk each feels comfortable accepting.

### Regulations That Affect Risk Posture
Regulations can have a dramatic effect on risk exposure.
- Sometimes that effect is a direct action of a regulation, such as financial firms being forced by regulators to have certain levels of encryption to protect certain types of processes. 

Regulations drive corporates responses because failing to follow regulations can result in penalties, which represent a loss. 
- Therefore regulations can be viewed as risks with almost certainty of incurring the loss.

**EXAM TIP: IT is important to remember that regulations apply to many areas of security. Know that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 protects investors from corporate fraud and bad financial reporting, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a set of security standards and policies for companies to follow in order to optimize security for consumer payment cards and associated private data.**

### Risk Assessment Types
**Def: A risk assessment is a method to analyze potential risk based on statistical and mathematical models.**
- You can use any one of a variety of models to calculate potential risk assessment values. A common method is the calculation of the annual loss expectancy (ALE). 
- Calculating the ALE creates a monetary value of the impact.

#### Qualitative
**Def: Qualitative risk assessment is the process of subjectively determining the impact of an event that affects a project, program, or business.**
- The risk matrix/heat map presented earlier is an example of qualitative risk models.

#### Quantitative
**Def: Quantitative risk assessment is the process of objectively determine the impact of an event that affects a project, program, or business.**
- Quantitative risk assessment usually involves the use of metrics and models to complete the assessment.
- Quantitative risk assessment applies historical information and trends to attempt to predict future performance.

**EXAM TIP: Understand the difference between quantitative and qualitative risk assessments. Quantitative means you can actually count something, whereas qualitative is more subjective, with values such as high, medium, or low.

### Likelihood of Occurrence
**Def: The likelihood of occurrence is the chance that a particular risk will occur.**
- This measure can be qualitative or quantitative, as just discussed. 
- For qualitative measures, the likelihood of occurrence is typically defined on an annual basis 
- For quantitative, it is used to create a rank-order outcomes.

### Impact
**Def: The impact of an event is a measure of the actual loss when a threat exploits a vulnerability.**
- 3 Levels of impact: high, medium, and low
- The common method is to define the impact levels in terms of important business criteria.

Risk is the chance of something not working as planned and causing an adverse impact.
- Impact is the cost associated with a realized risk.
- Impact can be in many forms--from human life, as in injury or death, to property loss, to loss of safety, financial loss, or loss of reputation.

#### Life
Many IT systems are involved in healthcare, and failures of some of these systems can and have resulted in injury and death to patients.
- IT systems are also frequently integral to the operation of machines in industrial settings, and their failure can have similar impacts
- Injury and loss of life are outcomes that backups cannot address and can result in consequences beyond others.

#### Property
Property damage can be the result of unmitigated risk. Property damage to company-owned property, property damage to property of others, and even environmental damage from toxic releases in industrial settings are all examples of damage that can be caused by IT security failures.

#### Safety
Safety is the condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury.
- Safety makes sense from both a business risk perspective and when you consider the level of concern one places for the well-being of people. 
- Unsafe conditions that are the result of computer issues will face the same regulatory wrath that unsafe plants have caused in manufacturing--fines and criminal complaints.

#### Finance
Finance is how we keep score.
- We can measure the gains through sales and profit, and we can measure the losses through unmitigated risks.
- What starts as a missed patch allows ransomware to infiltrate a system. This results in a business impact that eventually adds costs, which should be avoided.

#### Reputation
Corporate reputation is important in marketing.

**EXAM TIP: Risk is instantiated as impact. Impact can have effects on life, property, safety, reputation, and finances. Typically, multiple impacts occur from an incident, and finance always pays the bill. Be prepared to parse a question to determine whether its focus is risk, impact, or a specific consequence.**

### Asset Value
**Def: The asset value (AV) is the amount of money it would take to replace an asset.**
- This term is used with the exposure factor (EF), a measure of how much of an asset is a risk, to determine the single-loss expectancy (SLE). 

**EXAM TIP: Understand the terms, SLE, ALE, and ARO and how they are used to calculate a potential loss. You may be given a scenario, asked to calculate the SLE, ALE, or ARO, and presented answer choices that include values that result in incorrect calculations.**

### Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE)
**Def: The single-loss expectancy (SLE) is the value of a loss expected from a single event.**
- It is calculated using the following formula:
- SLE = asset value (AV) x exposure factor (EF)

Exposure factor (EF) is a measure of the magnitude of loss of an asset.
- For example, to calculate the exposure factor, assume the asset value of a small office building and its contents is $2 million.
- Also assume that this building houses the call center for a business, and the complete loss of the center would take away about half of the capability of the company.
- Therefore, the exposure factor is 50 percent, and the SLE is calculated as follows:
	- $ 2 million x 0.5 = $1 million 
	
### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
After the SLE has been calculated, the **annual loss expectancy** (ALE) is then calculated simply by multiplying the SLE by the likelihood or number of times the event is expected to occur in a year, which is called the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO):
- ALE = SLE x ARO

This represents the expected losses over the course of a year based on the ALE. If multiple events are considered, the arithmetic sum of all the SLEs and AROs can be calculated to provide a summation amount.

### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
**Def: The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is a representation of the frequency of the event, measured in a standard year.**
- If the event is expected to occur once in 20 years, then the ARO is 1/20
- Typically the ARO is defined by historical data, either from a company's own experience or from industry surveys.
- Continuing our example, assume that a fire at this business's location is expected to occur about once in 20 years. Given this information, the ALE is:
- $ 1 million x 1/20 = $50,000

The ALE determines a threshold for evaluating the cost/benefit ratio of a given countermeasure. Therefore, a countermeasure to protect this business adequately should cost no more than the calculated ALE of $50,000 per year.

**NOTE: Numerous resources are available to help in calculating ALE. There are databases that contain information to help businesses manage exposure to loss from natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and so forth. These databases include information on property perils such as fire, lightning, vandalism, windstorm, hail, and so forth, and even include granular information to help evaluate, for example, the effectiveness of your building's sprinkler systems.**

## Disasters
**Def: Disasters are major events that cause disruptions.**
- The timescale of the disruption can vary, as can the level of disruption, but the commonality is that the external event that caused the disruption is one that cannot be prevented.

**NOTE: Per FEMA, roughly 40 to 60 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a disaster. Follow a disaster, 90 percent of smaller companies fail within a year unless they can resume operations within five days.**

### Environmental 
One of the largest sources of threats is from the environment.
- Environmental changes can come form a wide variety of sources--weather, lightning, storms, and even solar flares--and these can cause changes to the system in a manner that disrupts normal operations.
- Make systems resilient can reduce impacts and mitigate these sources of risk to the enterprise.

### Person-made
**Def: Person-made threats are those that are attributable to the actions of a person.**
- They aren't just hostile actions but also accidents by users and system administrators.
- Users represent the greatest risk to an IT system

### Internal vs. External
As mentioned previously in the chapter, threats can come from internal and external sources.
- Internal threats have their origin within an organization, whereas external risks comes from the outside.
- Internal policy decision drives the risk of certain external outcomes.

**EXAM TIP: When performing a threat assessment, be sure to consider environmental, person-made, and internal threats. On the exam, carefully read the scenario preceding the question to differentiate which of these threat sources is the best answer, as multiple sources are common, but one is usually the higher risk.**

## Business Impact Analysis
**Def: Business impact analysis (BIA) is the process used to determine the sources and relative impact values of risk elements in a process.**
- It is also the name often used to describe a document created by addressing the questions associated with sources of risk and the steps taken to mitigate them in the enterprise.
- The BIA also outlines how the loss of any of your critical functions will impact the organization.

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
**Def: Recovery time objective (RTO) is used to describe the target time that is set for the resumption of operations after an incident.**
- This is a period of time that is defined by the business, based on the needs of the business. 
- A shorter RTO results in higher costs because it requires greater coordination and resources.
- This term is used in business continuity and disaster recovery operations.

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
**Def: Recovery point objective (RPO), a totally different concept from RTO, is the time period representing the maximum period of acceptable data loss.**
- The RPO defines the frequency of backup operations necessary to prevent unacceptable levels of data loss.
- A simple example of establishing RPO is to answer the following questions: How much data can you afford to lose? How much rework is tolerable?

**NOTE: RTO and RPO are seemingly related but in actuality measure different things entirely. The RTO serves the purpose of defining the requirements for business continuity, while the RPO deals with backup frequency. It is possible to have an RTO of 1 day and an RPO of 1 hour, or an RTO of 1 hour and an RPO of 1 day.**

**EXAM TIP: Know the difference between RTO and RPO. The RTO serves the purpose of defining the requirements for business continuity, while the RPO deals with backup frequency.**

### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR
**Def: Mean time to repair (MTTR) is a common measure of how long it takes to repair a given failure.**
- This is the average time, and it may or may not include the time needed to obtain parts. 
- MTTR = (total downtime) / (number of breakdowns)

Availability is a measure of the amount of time a system performs its intended function. 
- Reliability is a measure of the frequency of system failures
- Availability is related to, but different then reliability and is typically expressed as a percentage of time the system is in its operational state.
- To calculate availability both MTBF and the MTTR are needed:
	- Availability = MTBF / (MTBF+ MTTR)

Assuming a system has an MTBF of 6 months and the repair take 30 minutes, the availability would be:
-  Availability = 6 / (6 months+30mins) = 99.9884%

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
**Def: Mean Time between failures (MTBF) is a common measure of reliability of a system and is an expression of the average time between system failures.**
- The time between failures is measured from the time a system returns to service until the next failure. 
- The MTBF is an arithmetic mean of a set of system failures
- Mean time to failure (MTTF) is a variation of MTBF, one that is commonly used instead of MTBF when the system is replaced in lieu of being repaired. 

**EXAM TIP: Although MTBF and MTTR may seem similar, they measure different things. Exam questions may ask you to perform simple calculations. Incorrect answer choices will reflect simple mistakes in the ratios, so calculate carefully.**

### Functional Recovery Plans
**Def: Functional Recovery Plans involve the transition from operations under business continuity back to normal operations.**
- The functional recovery plan can be much more organized and staged over time, working to drive consistent efficiencies as opposed to speed. 
- This can be done function by function and is driven by the function needs.

### Single Point of Failure
**Def: A single point of failure (SPOF) is any system component whose failure or malfunctioning could result in the failure of the entire system.**


### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
**Def: A disaster recovery plan is the plan a firm creates to manage the business impact of a disaster and to recover from its impacts.**

### Mission-Essential Functions
When examining a risk and impacts to a business, it is important to identify mission-essential functions from other business functions.
- In most businesses, the vast majority of daily functions, although important, are not mission essential.

### Identification of Critical Systems
Enables the security team to properly prioritize defenses to protect the systems and data in a manner commensurate with the associated risk.
- It also enables the proper sequencing of restoring operations to ensure proper restoration of services.

### Site Risk Assessment 
**Def: A risk assessment tailored to a specific site.**
