# Chapter 33 
# Organizational Policies 

Policies and procedures govern the operation of the organization and represent a set of requirements developed from both internal and external sources.
- External requirements may come from laws and regulations, contractual terms, or customer specifications.
- Determining the relevant security policies and procedures that apply to third-party relationships is a key endeavor in ensuring that all elements of them are met during business operations.
- The bottom line is simple: in some business situations, policies and procedures may be mandated by outside regulation, and assistance may be required in ensuring compliance. 

## Personnel
A significant portion of human-created security problems results from poor security practices. 
- These poor practices may be those of an individual user who is not following established security policies or processes, or they may be caused by a lack of security polices, procedures, or training within the user's organization. 
- Through the establishment, enforcement, and monitoring of personnel-related policies --**personnel management**-- an organization can create a framework that empowers its workers to achieve business objects yet keeps them constrained within recommended security practices.

### Acceptable Use Policy
**Def: An acceptable use policy (AUP) outlines what the organization considers to be the appropriate use of its resources, such as computer systems, e-mail, Internet, and networks.**
- Organizations should be concerned about any personal use of organizational assets that does not benefit the company.

The goal of the policy is to ensure employee productivity while limiting potential organizational liability resulting from inappropriate use of the organization's assets.
- The policy should clearly delineate what activities are not allowed.\
- The AUP should address issues such as the use of resources to conduct personal business, installation of hardware or software, remote access to systems and networks, the copying of company-owned software, and the responsibility of users to protect company assets, including data, software, and hardware.

Related to appropriate use of the organization's computer systems and networks by employees is the appropriate use by the organization.
- The most important is whether the organization will consider it appropriate to monitor the employee's' use of the systems and network.

AUPs are important enough that they are typically presented to employees during on-boarding, with refreshers on an annual basis. 
- AUPs are the basis for employee behavior with systems, and the details need to be refreshed for people to be able to adhere to them.

**EXAM TIP: Make sure you understand that an acceptable use policy outlines what is considered acceptable behavior for a computer system's users. This policy often goes hand-in-hand with an organization's Internet usage policy.**

### Job Rotation 
Another policy that provides multiple benefits is **job rotation**. 
- Rotating through jobs provides individuals with a better perspective of how the various parts of the organization can enhance (or hinder) the business.
- Since security is often of secondary concern to people in their jobs, rotating individuals through security positions can result in a much wider understanding of the organization's security problems.
- A secondary benefit is that it also eliminates the need to rely on one individual for security expertise.

**EXAM TIP: Rotating users between roles helps to ensure that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained and improves security awareness across various roles in an organization.** 

### Mandatory Vacation
Organizations have been providing vacation time for their employees for many years.
- From a security standpoint, an employee who never takes time off is a potential indicator of nefarious activity.
- Employees who never take any vacation time could be involved in activity such as fraud or embezzlement and might be afraid that if they leave on vacation, the organization will discover their activities.
- Therefore mandatory vacation is a possible security protection mechanism.

### Separation of Duties
**Def: Separation of duties is a principle employed in many organizations to ensure that no single individual has the ability to conduct transactions alone.**
- This means that the level of trust in any one individual is lessened, and the ability for any individual to cause catastrophic damage to an organization is also lessened. 

Separating duties as a security tool is a good practice, but it is possible to go overboard and break up transactions into too many pieces or require too much oversight.

**EXAM TIP: Another aspect of the separation of duties principle is that it spreads responsibilities out over an organization so no single individual becomes the indispensable individual with all of the "keys to the kingdom" or unique knowledge about how to make everything work. If enough tasks have been distributed, assigning a primary and a backup person for each task will ensure that the loss of any one individual will not have a disastrous impact on the organization.**

### Least Privilege 
One of the most fundamental principles in security is **least privilege**.
- **Def: Least privilege means that an object should have only the rights and privileges necessary to perform its task, with no additional permissions.**
- Limiting privileges limits the amount of harm the object can cause, thus limiting the organization's exposure to damage.

**EXAM TIP: The principle of least privilege states that users should only have a level of access permissions required to perform their job.**

### Clean Desk Space
Preventing access to information is also important in the work area.
- Firms with sensitive information should have a clean desk policy specifying that sensitive information must not be left unsecured in the work area when the worker is not present to act as custodian.

### Background Checks
Personnel are key to security in the enterprise. Hiring good personnel has always been a challenge in the technical field, but it is equally important to hire trustworthy people, especially in key roles that have greater system access. 
- Performing routine **background checks** provides the HR team the necessary information needed to make the correct decisions. 

**Note: It is commonly heard that hiring a talented security hacker requires accepting someone with a shady past. The veracity of that comment aside, the real question to ask is not "Would I hire this person?" but rather "Would I be afraid of firing them?"**

### Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)
**Def: Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are standard corporate documents used to explain the boundaries of company secret material, information over which control should be exercised to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties.**
- NDAs can be executed between any two parties where one party wishes that the material being shared is not further shared, enforcing confidentiality via contract.

**EXAM TIP: Nondisclosure agreements are legally binding documents. Signed NDAs are often required by employers during the onboarding process to ensure employees are aware of privacy and confidentiality concerning company data.**

### Social Media Analysis
The rise of social media networks and applications has changed many aspects of business.
- Whether used for marketing communications, customer relations, or some other purpose, social media networks can be considered a form of third party.

The use of social media sites by employees at work brings in additional risks, in the form of viruses, worms, and spear phishing data collection.
- It is common for firms to use AUPs to restrict employee personal use of things like social media, peer-to-peer (p2p) networking, BitTorrent, and other non-work-related applications.

### Onboarding
A key element when onboarding new personnel is to ensure that the personnel are aware of and understand their responsibilities with respect to securing company information and assets. 
- Agreements with business partners tend to be fairly specific with respect to terms associated with mutual expectations associated with the process of the business. 

**EXAM TIP: Onboarding policy should include provisions for the handling of data, the disposal of data, acceptable use, and any sanctions that may occur as a result of misuse.**

### Offboarding
**Def: Offboarding refers to the processes and procedures used when an employee leaves an organization.**
- From a security perspective, the offboarding process for personnel is very important. 
- Employee termination needs to be modified to include termination or disablement of all accounts, including those enabled on mobile devices.

**EXAM TIP: Onboarding and offboarding business procedures should be well documented to ensure compliance with legal requirements.**

### User Training
**Def: User training is important to ensure that users are aware of and are following appropriate policies and procedures as part of their workplace activities.**
- As in all personnel-related training, two elements need attention.
	1. First, retraining over time is necessary to ensure that personnel keep proper levels of knowledge
	2. Second, as people change jobs, a reassessment of the required training basis is needed, and additional training may be required.

#### Gamification
**Def: Gamification is the use of games to facilitate user training**.

#### Capture the Flag
**Def: A capture-the-flag event is hands-on computer skill training where a user is tested to see if they can perform specific actions.**
- Should they perform the actions correctly, they uncover a flag 

#### Phishing Campaigns
**Def: Phishing campaigns are a series of connected phishing attacks against an organization.**
- Since phishing is an operational method of social engineering, the greater the level of institutional, organizational, and personal knowledge one possesses about their target, the greater the chance of success. 

#### Phishing Simulations
To help users learn and identify phishing attacks, there are methods of running **phishing simulations** against users.
- This creates a teachable moment where the user can receive training detailing exactly why they should have spotted the phishing attempt. 

#### Computer-Based Training (CBT)
**Def: Computer-Based Training (CBT) is the use of computer programs to manage training of users.**
- Self-paced modules can facilitate skill development across a wide range of skills.

#### Role-Based Training
For training to be effective, it needs to be targeted to the user with regard to their role in the subject of the training. 
- Personnel need role based training in areas where they have individual responsibilities

 **EXAM TIP: Be sure you are familiar with the various user training methods and how they play a role in organizational security.**

## Diversity of Training Techniques
Not all learners learn in the same fashion; some people learn by seeing, some people learn better by hearing. Almost everyone learns better by doing, but in some areas, doing a task is not practical or feasible. 
- The key is to match the material to the method and to the learners, and then test outcomes to ensure successful training has been achieved.

## Third-Party Risk Management
Every business will have third parties associated with their business operations. 
- Whether these third parties are vendors, suppliers, or business partners, they bring the opportunity for both risk and reward.
- **Third-party risk management** is a fairly straightforward process.
	- The first step is to recognize that risks are present
	- Risk does not magically vanish because a third party is involved; it still needs to be managed like all other business risks. 

### Vendors
**Def: Vendors are firms or individuals that supply materials or services to a business.**
- There's a wide range of risk that can be introduced by vendors, and these need to be examined and handled in accordance with standard risk management processes. 

### Supply Chain
**Def: A supply chain is a set of firms that operate together to manage the movement of goods and services between firms.**
- The need to understand and manage the risks of supply chain functions and their true costs became very evident during covid 2020. 
- It became clear that with extensive supply chain management, lower costs could be achieved, but at the risk of failure when the supply chain had issues. 

### Business Partners
**Def: Business partners are entities that share a relationship with a firm in their business pursuits.**
- With every partnership comes risk and reward; the key is in understanding the level of each and making business decisions with a clear understanding of these elements.

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)
**Def: A service level agreement (SLA) is negotiated agreement between parties detailing the expectations between a customer and a service provider.**
- SLA's essentially set the requisite level of performance of a given contractual service.
- Once entered into, the SLA becomes a legally binding document.

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
**Def: A memorandum of understanding (MOU) and memorandum of agreement (MOA) are legal documents used to describe a bilateral agreement between parties.**
- Typically a MOU has higher-level descriptions, whereas an MOA is more specific, but the boundary is a bit blurry.

### Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)
Many security risk management processes rely on measuring things or events. 
- **Def: Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA) is a field of study that examines measurement systems for accuracy and precision.**
- Performing a measurement systems analysis on the measurement systems employed in a security system is the structured process to get to that information and have confidence in the measures developed and used from the system. 

### Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)
**Def: A business partnership agreement (BPA) is a legal agreement between partners that establishes the terms, conditions, and expectations of their relationship.**
- The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), established by state law and convention, lays out a uniform set of rules associated with partnerships to resolve any partnership terms. 

**EXAM TIP: Be sure you understand the differences between the interoperability agreements. SLA, BPA, and MOU/MOA for the exam. All of them can be used to communicate security requirements between parties, but each is specific as to when it should be used. Look at usage for hints as to which would apply.**

### End of Life (EOL)
**Def: End of Life or end of support is when the manufacturer quits selling an item.**
- When something reaches EOL status, a upgrade and replacement needs to be executed immediately. 

### End of Service Life (EOSL)
**Def: End of service life (EOSL) is the term used to denote that something has reached the end of its "useful life".**
- Sometimes the end of updates will be a specified data in the future
- EOSL occurs typically because newer models have been released.

**EXAM TIP: Do not be confused! End of Life (EOL) is the term used to denote that something has reached the end of its "useful life". End of service life (EOSL) or end of support is when the manufacturer quits selling an item. In most cases, the manufacturer no longer provides maintenance services or updates.**

### NDA
Whenever information is shared with a party, inside or outside the company, if the sharing entity wishes to have to have contractual terms to limit sharing or disclosure, an NDA is used.

## Data 
System integration with internal and third parties frequently involves the sharing of data.
- Data can be shared for the purpose of processing or storage.
- Control over data is a significant issue in third-party relationships. 

### Classification
A key component of IT security is the protection of the information processed and stored on the computer systems and network.
- Organizations deal with many different types of information, and they need to recognize that not all information is of equal importance or sensitivity.

### Governance
**Def: Data governance is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data in enterprise systems.**
- Data governance should have established data standards and policies, that data elements are trustworthy, and the data doesn't get misused

### Retention
**Def: Data retention is the management of the data lifecycle with an emphasis on when data reaches its end of useful life for an organization.** 
- Developing data retention policy is relatively easy, but implementing it in an efficient and effective manner can be significantly more challenging given the diverse nature of data across the enterprise and the challenge presented by item-specific litigation holds.

**EXAM TIP: A litigation hold is a court directive to keep all records associated with a subject of legal proceeding, and this order takes precedence over normal data retention policies.**

## Credential Policies
**Def: Credential Policies refer to the processes, services, and software used to store, manage, and log the use of user credentials.**
- User-based credential management solutions are typically aimed at assisting end users in managing their growing set of passwords.

The key method used to control access to most systems is still one based on passwords.
- The need to be strong enough to resist attack, yet not too difficult for users to remember is important for passwords.

### Personnel
Users, or personnel, require credentials to access specific system resources as part of their job duties. 
- Management of who gets what credentials is part of the access and authorization management system and should be mentioned via a credential policy.

### Third Party
There are situations where third parties also require credentials.
- Whether credentials for a system or physical access, third party credentials should be managed by policies to ensure they are issued when needed to the correct parties.

### Devices 
**Def: Devices are physical items that require access to a network or enterprise system.**
- Device accounts should be controlled by policy and monitored to scope use.

### Service Accounts
**Def: Service accounts are special accounts that are used to provision permissions for service, or non-human-initiated system activity.**
- The enterprise needs a policy to determine who can enable and operate these accounts as well as their audit functions.

**EXAM TIPS: Because device and service accounts do not have human operators using them, their passwords have special properties, including very long expiration periods. This makes them more susceptible to abuse, so their scope and usage should be monitored.**

### Administrator/Root Accounts
**Def: Administrator and root accounts have elevated privileges and require closer scrutiny as to who is issued these credentials and how they are used and monitored.**

## Organizational Policies
The important parts of any organization's approach to implementing security include the polices, procedures, standards, and guidelines that are established to detail what users and admins should be doing to maintain the security of the systems and network.

Policies are high-level broad statements of what the organization wants to accomplish. 
- They are made by management when laying out the organization's position on some issue

Procedures are step-by-step instructions on how to implement policies in the organization.
- They describe exactly how employees are expected to act in a given situation or to accomplish a specific task.

### Change Management
**Def: The purpose of change management is to ensure proper procedures are followed when modifications to the IT infrastructure are made.**
- A change management process should include various stages, including a method to request a change to the infrastructure, a review and approval process for the request, an examination of the consequences of the change, resolution, implementation of the change, the documentation of the process as it related to the change.

### Change Control
**Def: Change control is the process of how changes to anything are sourced, analyzed, and managed.**
- Change control is a subset of change management, focused on the details of a change and how it is documented.

**EXAM TIP: Change management is about the process of applying change. Change control is the details of the change itself.**

### Asset Management
**Def: Asset management is the policies and processes used to manage the elements of the system, including hardware, software, and the data that is contained within them.**
