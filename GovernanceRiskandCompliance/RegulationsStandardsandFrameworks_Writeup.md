# Chapter 32 
# Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks

Developing the correct set of policies, procedures, and operations to achieve a desired level of organizational security is a complex set of tasks with many interdependencies. To assist organizations with developing and deploying these plans are numerous applicable regulations, standards, and frameworks that can impact organizational security posture. This chapter explores these information sources and examines how they can be employed.

## Regulations, Standards, and Legislation
Business operations never happen in a vacuum; there are at least some policies and procedures one must follow. 
- But these policies and procedures get their direction from regulations, standards, and legislation.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
**Def: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was a sweeping rewrite of European privacy regulations, went into effect in May of 2018.**
- The GDPR ushers in a brand-new world with respect to data protection and privacy.
- For all firms that wish to trade with the EU, there is now a set of privacy regulations that will require specific programs to address the requirements

The GDPR brings many changes--one being the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO). 
- This role may be filled by an employee or a third-party service provider, and it must be a direct report to the highest management level. 
- The DPO should operate with significant independence, and provisions in the GDPR restrict control over the DPO by management

The GDPR requires significant consideration, including the following:
- Assess personal data flows from the EU to the U.S. to define the scale and scope of the cross-border privacy-compliance challenge
- Assess readiness to meet model clauses, remediate gaps, and organize audit artifacts of compliance with the clauses.
- Update privacy programs to ensure they are capable of passing an EU regulator audit.
- Conduct EU data-breach notification stress tests
- Monitor changes in EU support for model contracts and binding corporate rules.

The GDPR specifies requirements regarding consent, and they are significantly more robust than previous regulations. Consent requirements are also delineated for specific circumstances:
- Informed/affirmative consent to data processing. Specifically, "a statement or a clear affirmative action" from the data subject must be "freely given, specific informed and unambiguous"
- Explicit consent to process special categories of data. Explicit consent is required for "special categories" of data, such as genetic data, biometric data, and data concerning sexual orientation.
- Explicit parental consent for children's personal data
- Consent must be specific to each data-processing operation, and the data subject can withdraw consent at any time.

**EXAM TIP: Remember that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifies requirements for collecting personal information in the European Union**

### National, Territory, or State Laws
Laws are the system of rules, or statutes, made by the government of a country, state, or city. 
- Statutes are enacted by a legislative body and then signed by the ranking official (president/governor). 
- **Def: Computer trespass is the unauthorized entry into a computer system via any means, including remote network connections.**

Across the world, it is treated as a crime and unauthorized entry and use of computer resources is treated as a crime with significant punishments.

**Def: The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 addresses a myriad of legal privacy issues that resulted from the increasing use of computers and other technology specific to telecommunications.**
- Section I was designed to modify federal wiretap statutes to include electronic communications
- Section II was designed to establish criminal sanction for unauthorized access to stored electronic records or communications.
- Section III covers pen registers and tap and trace issues. 

A major provision of ECPA was the prohibition against an employer's monitoring an employee's computer usage, including e-mail, unless consent is obtained. 

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986 which was amended up to 2008 criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems.
- The act also makes it a crime to knowingly transmit a program, code, or command that results in damage.
- Trafficking in passwords or similar access information is also criminalized

In the wake of several high-profile corporate accounting/financial scandals in the US, the federal government in 2002 passed sweeping legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), overhauling the financial accounting standards for publicly traded firms in the US
- These changes were comprehensive, touching most aspects of business in one way or another.
- With respect to information security, one of the most prominent changes was the provision of Section 404 controls, which specify that all processes associated with the financial reporting of a firm must be be controlled and audited on a regular basis.

Section 404 requires firms to establish a control-based framework designed to detect or prevent fraud that would result in misstatement of financials.
- In simple terms, these controls should detect insider activity that would defraud the firm.

California Senate Bill 1386 (SB 1386) was a landmark law concerning information disclosures. 
- It mandates that Californians be notified whenever PII is lost or disclosed.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
The payment card industry, including the powerhouses of MasterCard and Visa, through its PCI Security Standards Council, designed a private sector initiative to protect payment card information between banks and merchants. 
- **Def: The payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) is a set of contractual rules governing how credit card data is to be protected.**
- current version is 3.2
- PCI DSS is a voluntary, private sector initiative that is proscriptive in its security guidance.

**EXAM TIP: The payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) protects customer credit card information and is designed to reduce fraud. The contractual standard has a steep financial penalty for noncompliance.**

## Key Frameworks
Frameworks provide a means of assessing the path through the maze of regulator requirements and how they relate to risk management.
- One of the challenging aspects of cyber-security operations is determining where one should concentrate efforts, how resources should be deployed, and what balance of emphasis to place between short-term and long-term items to optimize efforts on risk mitigation. 
- Several types of key frameworks can be used as part of this analysis. In the following sections, we will look at frameworks from the Center for Internet Security, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, several ISO standards, SSAE standards, and the Cloud Security Alliance.

### Center for Internet Security (CIS)
**Def: The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a nonprofit organization that severs the cybersecurity community in a number of ways.**
- It is the guardian of the CIS controls--a set of the top 20 security controls that should be implemented as a baseline of cybersecurity risk management
- This list provides a roadmap of what security controls should be implemented first, second, so on.

The CIS has also published a set of CIS benchmarks.
- These benchmarks are consensus-developed, secure configuration guidelines for hardening a wide range of technical items.

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)/ Cyber Security Framework (CSF)
**Def: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides recommended strategies to the US government and others on how to handle a wide range of issues, including risk from cybersecurity issues.**
- The approach taken by NIST is one built around the management of organizational risk through a **risk management framework** (RMF) associated with cybersecurity activities.
- The NIST RMF is composed of more than 10 publications, spanning virtually every activity associated with cybersecurity.

A second activity published by NIST is the **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. 
- The CSF is designed to assist organization in the early stages of planning their cybersecurity posture.
- It breaks down the types of activities into five different function: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. 

The third leg of NIST efforts in cybersecurity documentation is the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cyber Security Workforce Framework.
- This is an effort to define the ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development needed to create the workforce needed in cybersecurity in government and in industry.

### International Organization For Standardization (ISO) 27001/27002/2770/31000
**Def: ISO 27001 is the international standard defining an information security management system (ISMS).**
- ISO 27001 is one of many related standards in the 27000 family. 
- ISO 27002 is a document that defines security techniques and a code of practice for information security controls. 
- ISO 27701 is a privacy extension to the 27000 series and adds the requirements to establish and maintain a privacy information management system. 
- The ISO 31000 series is a set of guidelines, principles, framework, and process for managing risk
- ISO 31000 addresses all forms of risk and management, not just cybersecurity risk.

### SSAE SOC 2 TYPE I/II
**Def: Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) is a set of auditing standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Auditing Standards Board.**
- SOC stands for Service Organization Controls
- An SOC 2 report focuses on the internal controls at an organization related to compliance or operations, wrapped around the five trust principles (security, confidentiality, processing integrity, availability, and privacy). 
- The SOC 2 is a separate report that focuses on controls at a service provider relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system.
- SOC 2 reports come in two forms: Type I and Type II. 
	- Type I reports evaluate whether proper controls are in place at a specific point in time.
	- Type II reports are done over a period of time to verify operational efficiency and effectiveness of the controls.

**EXAM TIP: SSAE SOC 2 reports focus on internal controls related to compliance or operations. A SOC Type I report evaluates whether proper controls are in place at a specific point in time. A SOC Type II report is done over a period of time to verify operational efficiency and effectiveness of the controls.**

### Cloud Security Alliance
Born in 2008 and incorporated in 2009, the Cloud Security Alliance issued the first comprehensive best-practice documents for secure cloud computing, "Security guidance for critical areas of focus for cloud computing" and has become the industry body for frameworks, benchmarks, and standards associated with cloud computing worldwide. 
- Some key documents developed include the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), the user credential Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK), the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) credential and a security framework for government clouds. 

#### Cloud Controls Matrix
**Def: The Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) is a meta-framework of cloud-specific security controls, mapped to leading standards, best practices, and regulations.** 
- This document uses 16 domains to cover 133 security control objectives to address all key aspects of cloud security. 

#### Reference Architecture
The Cloud Security Alliance has an Enterprise Architecture Working Group (EAWG) that has developed the Enterprise Architecture for cloud deployments and services. 
- This framework serves as both a methodology and a set of tools that can be utilized by security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management professionals.

**EXAM TIP: Be prepared to identify Cloud Security Alliance items by their acronyms and understand the difference between them. The Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a broad framework describing all aspects, while the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a list of security controls for the cloud.**

## Benchmarks and Secure Configuration Guides
**Def: Benchmarks and secure configuration guides offer guidance for setting up and operating computer systems to a secure level that is understood and documented.**
- As each organization may differ, the standard for a benchmark is a consensus-based set of knowledge designed to deliver a reasonable set of security across as wide a base as possible.
- There are three main sources for these guides: manufacturers of the software, the government, and independent organizations such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).

**EXAM TIP: Organizations often refer to Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks to develop secure configuration postures.**

### Platform/Vendor-Specific Guides
Setting up services is important to enterprises, and some of the best guidance comes from the manufacturer in the form of **platform/vendor-specific guides**. These guides include installation and configuration guidance, and in some cases operational guidance as well.

#### Web Server
Many different web servers are used in enterprises, but the market leaders are Microsoft, Apache, and Nginx. 
- **Def: web servers offer a connection between users (clients) and web pages (data being provided), and as such they are prone to attacks.**

Another good source of information is from the Center of Internet Security  (CIS) as part of its benchmarking guides. 
- The CIS guides provide authoritative, proscriptive guidance developed as part of a consensus effort among consultants, professionals, and others.
- CIS guides are available for multiple versions of Apache, Microsoft, and other vendors' products.

#### OS
**Def: The operating system (OS) is the interface for the applications that we use to perform tasks and the actual physical computer hardware.**
- As such, the OS is a key component for the secure operation of a system. 
- Comprehensive, proscriptive configuration guides for all major operating systems are available from their respective manufacturers, from the Center for Internet Security and from the DoD DISA STIGs program.

#### Application Server 
**Def: Application servers are the part of the enterprise that handles specific tasks we associate with IT systems.**
- Proper configuration of an application server depends to a great degree on the server specifics.
- Standard application servers, such as e-mail and database servers, have guidance from the manufacturer, CIS and STIGs.

#### Network Infrastructure Devices
**Def: Network Infrastructure devices are the switches, routers, concentrators, firewalls, and other specialty devices that make the network function smoothly.**
- Properly configuring these devices can be challenging but is very important because failures at this level can adversely affect the security of traffic being processed by them
- In most investigations the only way to tell if a firewall failed is if after an incident it is discovered to have not done its job.
