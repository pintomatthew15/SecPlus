# Physical Security Controls 

## Bollards/Barricades
The primary defense against a majority of physical attacks is the barricades between the assets and a potential attacker --walls, fences, gates, and doors.

These are the foundations upon which all other security initiatives are based, but the security must be designed carefully, as an attacker has to find only a single gap to gain access. 

**Def: The simple post-type barricade that prevents a vehicle from passing but allows people to walk past is called a bollard.**

**Exam Tip: Bollards are sturdy posts often made of concrete or galvanized or stainless steel. They are used to protect entry ways and prevent unauthroized entry or vehicle ramming attacks.**

If you are going to use a wall to protect an asset, make sure no obvious holes appear in the wall.

**Exam Tip: Windows or no windows? Windows provide visibility, allowing people to observe activities in the server room. This can provide security if those doing the observing have authority to see activity in the server room. If those outside do not have this authority, then windows should be avoided.**

**Exam Tip: All entry points to server rooms and wiring closets should be closely controlled, and, if possible, access should be logged through an access control system.**

---
## Access Control Vestibules
The implementation of an access control vestibule, also called a mantrap, is one way to combat tailgating. 

**Def: An access control vestibule is composed of two closely spaced doors that require the user to card through one and then the other sequentially.**

Mantraps make it nearly impossible to trail through a doorway undetected.


**Exam Tip: An access control vestibule door arrangement can prevent unauthorized people from following authorized users through an access-controlled door, which is also known as tailgating.**

---
## Badges
As organizations grow, some form of identification becomes required to distinguish and identify individuals. 

A badge with a picture on it can enable others to quickly determine if you are an employee or not. 

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and record information. 

RFID tags are widely used in identification badges, replacing earlier magnetic stripe cards and making them usable with just a swipe near a reader. 

---
## Alarms
Alarms serve to alert operators to abnormal conditions. Physical security can involve numerous sensors, intrusion alarms, motion detectors, switches that alert to doors being opened, video and audio surveillance, and more.

Tuning alarms so that they provide useful, accurate, and actionable information is important if you wnat them to be effective.

**Exam Tip: Lighting, signs, fencing, and alarms are all items readily associated with physical security. The proper answer to an exam question will be based on the specific details of the question-- watch for the clues and pick the best answer based on the context of the question.**

---
## Signage
Signs act as informational devices and can be used in a variety of ways to assist in physical security. 

Signage can provide information as to areas that are restricted, or it can indicate where specific precautions, such as keeping doors locked, are required. 

Visual clues as to the types of protection required can take the form of different-color name badges that signify the level fo access, visual lanyards that indicate visitors colored folders, and so forth.

---
## Cameras
Cameras are an important tool for security. The old adage " a picture is worth a thousand words" consistently rings true, and this is especially true in secuirty.

Cameras enable the recreation of scenes at later dates. 

Video cameras offer an even greater range of surveillance capability, and closed-circuit TV cameras are covered in a later section.

### Motion Recognition
Motion recognition is an important technology to limit the search time and recording space associated with video images.

Infrared (IR) radiation is not visible to the human eye, but it can be used just like a light source to detect a range of things.

IIR alarms are used extensively to monitor movement of people in areas where there should be none. 

### Object Detection
Modern surveillance video systems come with some impressive software.

Even cameras sold to homeowners can scan video for movement and detect people, cars, and other designated objects such as packages left on a porch. 

Ex: The citywide video surveillance system in London was the primary source of evidence that identified the terrorists who set off a series of bombs across the city in 2005.

---
## Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)
Video surveillance is typically done through **closed-circuit television (CCTV)**. 

The use of CCTV cameras for surveillance purposes dates back to at least 1961, when cameras were installed in the London Transport train station.

The development of smaller camera components and lower costs has casued a boon in the CCTV industry since then. 

CCTV cameras are used to monitor a workplace for security purposes and are often found in banks and jewelry stores-- places with high-value merchandise that is attractive to thieves.

Traditional cameras are analog based and require a video multiplexer to combine all the signals and make multiple views appear on a monitor. 

Digital, IP-based cameras have changed that, as most of them are stand-alone units that are viewable through a web browser. 

These IP-based systems add useful functionality, such as the ability to check on the building from the Internet. 

This makes the cameras subject to normal IP-based network attacks. A DoS attack launched at the CCTV system just as a break-in is occurring is the last thing that anyone would want.

IP-based CCTV cameras should be placed on their own separate network that can be accessed only by security personnel. 

If you depend on a CCTV system to protect your organization's assets, carefully consider camera placement and the type of cameras used.

## Industrial Camouflage
**Def: Camouflage is the specific act of rendering an item not readily observable.**

Considered by many to be a military thing, camouflage began in nature, where insects and animals have patterns making them seem to be different than they really are. 

Cell phone towers built to look like trees make them less conspicuous-- and generally improve the visual surroundings. 

Examples of industrial camouflage in action:
- 58 Joralemon Street, NYC- ventilation shaft 
- 640 Millwood Road, Toronto Canada- an electrical substation
- 51 W. Ontario Street Chicago Illinois- an electrical substation

---
## Personnel
Physical security should be a part of a firm's overall security program. 

Physical security measures are those taken to ensure the separation of items to be protected from all forms of physical risk. 

### Guards
Security guards provide an excellent security measure, becasue guards are a visable presence with direct responsibility for secuirty. 

Guards typically monitor entrances and exists and can maintain access logs of who has entered and departed the building. 

Security personnel are helpful in physically securing the machines on which information assets reside, but to get the most benefit from their presence, they must be trained to take a holistic approach to security.

### Robot Sentries
Guard duty is by and large boring work, and although guards aren't highly paid over time, having a number of guards can be expensive. 

Robot technology has progressed to the point where robots can now perform many simple tasks, and guard duty can be one of these tasks. 

**Robot sentries** can patrol empty buildings and using sensors can detect the presence of unauthorized people. 

### Reception
**Reception areas** are used as buffer zones between different areas of a facility, segmenting the building into separate regions.

In very highly controlled environments, the actual door control is done remotely from the other side of the door so that people can't force their way past the receptionist.

### Two-Person Integrity/Control 
When tasks are critical, or failures could involve significant risk, the organizational principle of separation of duties applies. 

When there are physical tasks, such as opening the door mentioned in the previous section,  having two people required to perform the task provides a means of checks and balances.

**Def: Two-person integrity/control is this principle in action: it is when two different people have to perform respective tasks that are both neccessary for the action to occur.**

---

## Locks
Locks are a common security measure that are used with near ubiquity. Everyone is familiar with using a lock to secure something.

Laptops should be locked in a desk drawer when not in use. Desktop towers should be used in a desk that allows those towers to be locked when not in use. 

### Biometrics
**Def: The measurement of biological attributes or processes with the goal of identification of a party posessing those measurements.**

The most known biometric factor is the fingerprint. 

Other biometric measurments that can be used for physical secuirty purposes include the retina or iris of the eye, the gemoetry of the hand, and the geometry of the face.

Biometrics are frequently used in physical security and are becoming nearly ubiquitous for controlling access to mobile devices, such as phones and tablets. 

Biometrics are not fool proof. Some biometric measures can be duplicated to fool a sensor, and in many cases, the actual biometric is converted to a number that can also be intercepted and used in a software attack. 

### Electronic
**Def: are devices that impede a specific function unless a code is entered.**

Electronic locks have an advantage in that they are not as susceptible to mechanical manipulation and bypass, yet they are still susceptible, in many cases via the mechanism that updates the secret "combination"

### Physical
Physical locks have been used for hundreds of years; their design has not changed much: a metal "token" is used to align pins in a mechanical device. 

Humans are always trying to build a better mousetrap, and that applies to locks as well. High-security locks, have been designed to defeat attacks; these locks are more sophisticated than a standard home deadbolt system.

High-end lock security is more important now that attacks such as "bump keys" are well known and widely available. A bump key is a key cut with all notches to the maximum depth, also known as "all nines." 

Combination locks, which work via a rotating dial, are common on high-end safes and can raise the security level substantially. In many cases, the only way to bypass one of these locks is to physically bypass the lock itself through drilling or other methods. 

### Cable Locks
Portable equipment has a principal feature of being portable. 

This can also be a problem, as portable equipment--laptops, projectors and the like--can be easily removed or stolen.

Cable locks can be used by road warriors to secure laptops from casual theft. They can also be used in open areas such as conference centers or rooms where portable equipment is exposed to a wide range of vistors.

## USB Data Blocker
USB connectors on computers offer a pathway for data to enter into the system. 

Anyone who has physical access to a machine can plug into a USB device and execute code from the device.

There are a variety of ways to block USB ports or render them inoperable, but in some cases, the USB port serves a secondary function as a power source for external devices

The USB connection has four conductors: two for power and two for data. 

If you block the data conductors, you can still charge your device from a USB source without giving that device any  access to the data.

When charging your phone in locations such as airports, or other unknown power sources, the use of a **USB data blocker** protects the phone but allows it to charge.

**Exam Tip: A USB data blocker prevents attackers from infecting a device with malware or stealing data.  Also remember that turning off the AutoPlay setting in the operating system will prevent malicious code from automatically running when you plug in a USB or other external media device.**

---
## Lighting 
Proper lighting is essential for physical security. 

Unlit or dimly lit areas allow intruders to lurk and conduct unauthorized activities without a significant risk of observation by guards or other personnel.

Unauthroized parties in server rooms are more likely to be detected if the servers are centrally located, surrounded in windows, and well lit.

---
## Fencing
Fencing serves as a physical barrier around property. It can serve to keep people out or in, preventing the free movement across unauthorized areas.

Fencing can be an important part of a phyiscal security plan. Properly employed, it can help secure areas from unauthorized visitors. 

Inside a building, fencing can be used to provide a means of restricting entry into areas where separate phyiscal secuirty policies apply.

Material storage, servers, networking gear, and other sensitive items can be separated from unauthorized access with simple chain link fences. 

These areas are typically called a **cage** and entry/exit to the caged areas is via a **gate**. The gate allows controlled access and makes it easier to monitor who and what enters and leaves the controlled area. 

Gates are used for external fencing as well. Gates offer a monitoring point for ingress and egress from a controlled area. 

---
## Fire Suppression
According to the Fire Suppression Systems Association (www.fssa.net), 43 percent of businesses that close as a result of a significant fire never reopen.

An additional 29 percent fail within three years of the event. The ability to respond to a fire quickly and effectively is this critical to the long-term success of any organization.

Fire suppression systems are designed to provide protection against the damage from a fire that spreads in a facility. 

Because they are suppression systems, they don't prevent the fire from occuring per se, but they do stop it once it begins. 

### Water-Based Fire Suppression Systems
Water and electric equipment do not get along well. 

The 2017 NFPA 75: Standard for the Protection of Information Technology Equipment outlines measures that can be taken to minimize the damage to elctornic euipment exposed to water.

### Clean-Agent Fire Suppression Systems
Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been used as a fire suppression agent for a long time.

It displaces oxygen so that the amount of oxygen remaining is insufficient to sustain the fire. It also provides some cooling in the fire zone and reduces the concentration of "gasified" fuel.

Argon extinguishes fire by lowering the oxygen concentration below the 15% level required for combustible items to burn.

Intergen, a product of Ansul Corportation, is composed of three gases: 52% nitrogen, 40% argon, and 8% carbon dioxide. 

### Handheld Fire Extinguishers
Although computer security professionals typially do not have much influence over the type of fire suppression system that their office includes, they do need to be aware of what ype has been installed, what they should do in case of an emergency, and what they need to do to recover after the relaese of the system. 

Automatic fire suppresion systems designed to discharge when a fire is detected are not the only systems you should be aware of.

If a fire can be caught and contained before the automatic systems discharge, it can mean significant savings to the organization in terms of both time and equipment costs. 

Handheld extinguishers are common in offices, but the correct use of them must be understood; otherwise, disaster can occur.

### Fire Detection Devices
An essential complement to fire suppression systems and evices are fire detection devices (fire detectors).

There are several types of fire detectors. One type, of which there are two varieties, is activated by smoke. 
- The two varieties of smoke detector are ionization and photoelectric. A photoelectric detector is good for potentially providing advance warning of a smoldering fire. 
- An ionization style of detector uses an ionization chamber and a small radioactive source to detect fast-burning fires. 

Both of these devices are often referred to generically as smoke detectors, and combinations of both varieties are possible. 

As both of these devices are triggered by the interruption of a signal, without regard to why, they can give false alarms. They are unable to distringuish the difference between the smoke from a kitchen fire and burned toast.

Another type of fire detector is activated by heat. 

A third type of detector is flame activated.

---
## Sensors
One of the first items in the security equation is detection. 

Detection of a specific signal can then be compared to a reference as to if it is allowed or not.

For instance, a motion detector that is trained to detect oncoming traffic can sense someone going the wrong way in a tunnel or controlled exit space.


### Motion Detection
When monitoring an area for unauthorized activity, one potentially useful tool is a **motion  detector**. 

In areas where there is little or no expected traffic, a motion detector can alert an operator to activity in an area. 

Motion detectors come in a variety of types, but most are based on infrared (heat) radiation and can detect the changes of a warm body moving.

Vidoe monitoring of the loading dock are in the back of the building can be triggered in this fashion, using the motion detector to turn on cameras whenever activity is occuring.

### Noise Detection
**Def: A sensor method that listens for specific sounds.**

Ordinary things can produce different sounds, and each of these can have a specific spectral signature that can be used to hear some items while ignoring others.

Ex: Glass breakage has a specific sound, and sensors can be tuned to "hear" glass breakage provide an alert when it occurs.

### Proximity Reader
**Def: Sensors that provide a signal at a specified distance.**

The most common application of these are card readers connected to doors: you "swipe" your card by placing it near the reader, and if the codes are correct, you are granted access. 

A series of proximity readers scattered throughout a facility can act as a reporting sensor, monitoring guards as they traverse their appointed rounds.

With near field communication (NFC) and advanced Bluetooth via smartphones, the uses of proximity readers beyond just paying for things is growing exponentially.

### Moisture Detection
Moisture, or water, can have significant detrimental effects on certain items.

**Moisture detection** sensors provide a remote means of monitoring everything from water leaks to humidity problems.

Water can cause damage to electronics, artwork, and many other items.

As in all sensors, the objective is to provide better "eyes and ears" for the security personnnel, allowing 24/7 coverage of issues, many times in remote areas, for conditions that may require attention.

### Cards
Controlling physical access to a small facility can be achieved through door locks and physical keys, but that solution is unwieldy for larger facilities with numerous people coming and going. 

Many organizations rely on a badging system using either tokens or cards that can be tied to automated ID checks and logging of entry/exit.

Tokens are cards offer the same function as keys, but the ystem can be remotely updated to manage access in real time, and users can have their privileges revoked without a company or admin having to recover the token or card.

### Temperature
Temperature sensors do exactly what you'd think: they sense temperatures. 

Server rooms are highly temperature-controlled areas, with hot and cold sides, as servers to generate heat, and that heat needs to be removed.

An analytical monitoring solution can then alert the appropriate personnel when certain temperature ranges are exceeded.

**Exam Tip: The use of sensors as part of an overall physical security solution is important. There are many things that need to be monitored, and using sensors with automation to assist the security team in seeing out-of-range conditions is important. The objective is to understand the importance of physical security, and that includes the specific details measured by sensors.**

---
## Drones
The use of drones has risen sharply in the past couple of years. From home/hobbyist models that can carry a small camera, to larger industrial rigs that can carry larger cameras for longer periords, these devices have revolutionized remote viewing of items. 

These offer interesting use cases for both offense and defense in cybersecurity, because they can be used to surveil physical facilities remotely, providing eyes on demand in a variety of places you might not want a person to go to and in a timeframe that can't be met any other way.

---
## Vistor Logs
Physical security **vistitor logs** provide the same utility as computer logs for a security investigation.

They act as a record for what was observed at specific points at time.

Remote sensing of badges and equipment utilzing RFID tags can create an automatic log of equipment movement, including information about when, where, what, and who.

**Exam Tip: Cameras, IR detection, motion detection, and logs are all methods associated with detection--and frequently after-the-fact detection at that. These devices and methods provide valuable attribution fact patterns, even after the actual event.**

---

## Faraday Cages
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is an electrical disturbance that affects an electrical circuit. 

EMI can plague any type of electronics, but the density of circuity in the typical data center can make it a haven for EMI.

An example of shielding that can be employed is a Faraday cage or Faraday shield, which is an enclosure of conductive material that is grounded. 

This can be room-sized or built into a building's construction; the critical element is that there is no significant gap in the enclosure material. 

**Exam Tip: When it comes to shielding, understand the difference between a Faraday cage (as a large open space) and EMI shielding on cables (very specific shielding and which is appropriate based on what is being protected from EMI.

---

## Air Gap
Air gap is a term used to describe the physical and lgoical separation of a network from all other networks. 

This separation is designed to prevent unauthorized data transfers to and from the network.

Frequently called "sneaker net," this unauthorized bypassing of the air gap, although ostensibly for the purpose of mission accomplishment, increases system risk because it also bypasses checks, logging, and other processes important in development and deployment.

---
## Screened Subnet
The concept of a screened subnet (previously known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ) comes from military parlance where it represents an area that is not "owned" by either side.

The concept is used in networking to indicate a zone where access controls are not as strict as the inside, or as open as the outside; it's a place of joint cooperation and controlled risk. 

In the physical world, a lobby acts as a DMZ and are areas of controlled risk.

---
## Protected Cable Distribution 
Cable runs between systems need to be protected from physical damage to the cables and subsequent communication failures. 

This is accomplished by **protected distribution/ protected cabling** during the cabale installation. 

The objective is to prevent any physical damage to the physical layer portion of the system.

The protection of entire systems is covered in the earler section "Faraday Cages"

---
## Secure Areas
**Def: Areas where specific preventative measures are taken to control access both to and from.**

There are a wide range of levels for these areas.

The overall idea behind a secure area is to limit information and people flow in and out of the area, and when it is permitted it is under the proper level of control.


### Air Gap
**Def: A system where there is no direct connection to outside systems.**

An air-gapped network does not have connetion to outside networks.

An air gap for a network extends to all physical connections, wired and wireless, and exists to protect a computer or network from outside influences or to keep data from leaving the system. 

In practice, when air gaps are used they have to be monitored for connections that occur around them, ensuring the system remains isolated.

### Vault
**Def: A secured area that is designed to provide a specific level of security for what is stored inside**

This can be a physical space, with specifc safeguards such as walls that cannot be penetrated and  doors that can be secure.

### Safe
**Def: Physical storage devices that are intended to impede unauthorized access to their protected contents.**

The higher the level of protection from the physical environment, the better the level of protection against unauthorized access.

Sometimes a safe is not necessary and a secure cabinet or enclosure works just as well.

Secure enclosures can provide security against some forms of physical access, as in users, yet still provide the proper environmental controls and setting necessary for operation. Safes cannot do this.

### Hot and Cold Aisles
The trend toward smaller, denser servers means more servers and devices per rack, putting a greater load on the cooling systems. 

This encourages the use of hot aisle/cold aisle layout. 

A data center that is arranged into hot and cold aisles dicates that all the intake fans on all equipment face the cold aisle and that the exhaust fans all face the opposite aisle.

The benefits of this arrangement are the cooling is more efficient and can handle higher density

**Note: Understanding airflow allows you to understand hot and cold aisles. Cold air is produced by the HVAC equipment, and this cold air is sent to servers. The servers shed their heat, making air hot, which is removed. The aisles keep the hot air from mixing with the cold air, making the cooling efficient. You wouldn't leave a door open in summer with the air conditioning on, would you?**

## Secure Data Destruction
When data is no longer being used, it is important to destroy the data before losing physical control over the media that is on it.


Remember dumpster diving, people can find your old hardware and steal valuable information.

It is critical for every organization to have a strong disposal and destruction policy and related procedures.

### Burning
Buring is considered one of the gold-standard methods of data destruction. Once the storage media is rendered into a form that can be destroyed by fire, the chemical processes of fire are irreversible and render the data lost forever.


### Shredding 
Shredding is the physical destruction by tearing an item into many small pieces, which can thene be mixed, making reassembly difficult but not impossible.

### Pulping
**Def: process by which paper fibers are suspended in a liquid and recombined into new paper.**

Only used in paper

### Pulverizing
**Def: a phyiscal process of destruction using excessive physical force to break an item into unusable pieces.**

Pulverizers are used on items like hard disk drives, destroying the platters in a manner that they cannot be reconstructed.

A more modern method of pulverizing the data itself is the use of encryption. The data on the device is encrypted and the key itself is destroyed. 

### Degaussing 
**Def: Destroying the data magnetically, using a strong magnetic field to degauss the media.**

Deguassing realigns the magnetic particles, remvoing the organized structure that represented the data. 

Media must be magnetic to work

### Purging 
**Def: a term used to describe methods that permanently erase and remove data from a storage space.**

Key word is remove data, for unlike deletion, which just destroys that data, purging is designed to open up the storage space for reuse. 

A circular buffer is a great example of an automatic purge mechanism.

### Third-Party Solution
There are contractors that sell data destruction as a service.

These vendors take advantage of scale, increasing the capability while sharing the cost of equipment. However, this also introduces a new form of data loss, through the use of a the third party that has access to the data before destruction.
